            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" style="text-decoration: none;">The Game of
                Life</a>, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John
            Horton Conway in 1970.
        </p>
        <p>The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of
            which is in one of <u>two possible states, <i>living or dead </i></u>.</p>
        <p>Whether a cell is dead or alive <u>depends on the cell's eight neighbours. </u></p>
        <p>Every turn, cells live, die or are "born" based on these rules:</p>
        <ol>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.</ol>
        <ol>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</ol>
        <ol>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.</ol>
        <ol>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</ol>
